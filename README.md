# Unit 8: Statistical Methods for Data Science
 
 Unit 8 explores three different types of inferential statistics methods and examines their similarities and differences. 
 - Frequentist Inference: regards probability as the expected frequency of a particular outcome when an experiment is run multiple times.
 - Bootstrap Inference: simulates reruns of an experiment to observe outcomes.
 - Bayesian Inference: treats probability as a reflection of your belief in a specific outcome.
 ### Learning Objectives
 1. Develop an understanding of frequentist, Bootstrap, and Bayesian inference. 
 2. Peform Hypothesis testing to identify statistical significance.
 3. Gain the ability to determine when a particular kind of statistical inference should be used over another.
 4. Understanding how hypothesis testing is applied in real-world applicatins such as A/B testing.
 
 Keywords: Confidence Intervals, Statistical Significance, Hypothesis Testing
